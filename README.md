# UITableViewWithImages
This is a sample repo which serves as a companion for this [blogpost]  on [My Day To-Do] 

At [My Day To-Do], we had to solve an optimisation problem when we were building our new app, [I Was There]. The optimisation issue was related to fixing significant slow-downs in an iOS solution that uses high resolution images captured by the device camera and displays it in a UITableView.

If you want to know more about it, have a read of our blogpost, [UITableView with images & performance issues]
